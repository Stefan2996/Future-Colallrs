## Extension of Program for Editing .CSV Files
### Exercise:
In this exercise, you will extend the previous CSV file modification program to also handle JSON and Pickle files. The program, "reader.py", will modify a CSV, JSON, or Pickle file, display its contents in the terminal, and then save it to a selected location. Make sure to use classes and inheritance in this program.

### Instructions:
1. **Write a program named "reader.py". This program will take in command-line arguments that specify the source file, destination file, and changes to be made.**
2. **The source (src) should be a path to a CSV, JSON, or Pickle file. If the file does not exist or the path is not a file, the program should display an error message and list the files in the same directory.**
3. **The destination (dst) should be the target path where the modified file will be saved.**
4. **The changes are strings in the form "X, Y, value", where X is the column (also counted from 0), Y is the row to be modified (counted from 0), and value is the new value for the specified cell.**
5. **The file type for both the source and destination files should be detected based on their extensions:**
   - .csv for CSV files
   - .json for JSON files
   - .pickle for Pickle files
6. **In the case of pickle and json, files are saved as lists of lists. Each row is a list of strings, and rows are stored in the list.**

Example command for running the program:

*python reader.py source.csv destination.json "0,0,piano" "1,1,mug"*

### Hints:
- Use Python's built-in csv, json, and pickle modules to handle reading and writing of files.
- Use Python's os module to handle file paths and to check if a file exists.
- Use Python's sys module to handle command-line arguments.

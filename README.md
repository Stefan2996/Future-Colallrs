## My Road to Programming
Hello everyone. This is not exactly my first work, it's something like a diary, the beginning of my path as a programmer. Here will not be just one of my works, but a whole path from the very basics, to hopefully at least some kind of working program... Or a website... Or an application. I don't know yet.

In fact, these are my homework assignments from the Python course from the Future Collars school, I hope they won't sue me for this.

Perhaps over time I will supplement this file, make it beautiful and pleasant to read...
